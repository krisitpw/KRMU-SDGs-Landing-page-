					<p class="card-text text-justify">
						Access to quality education plays pertinent role for sustainable development and a pre-requisite for the achievement of the other goals. Children who live in poverty are deprived of their basic rights to food, water, health care, education, protection, and shelter, which make it harder for them to improve their own lives and the lives of future generations. Without global action, social inequality will likely become entrenched and the most vulnerable girls and boys will be denied access to the services they require to survive and develop.</p>

						Universities conduct fundamental research that is crucial to understanding how nature and the earth&rsquo;s ecosystems function. They gather people from various disciplines, with different approaches and talents to find innovative solutions to the world&rsquo;s challenges. Research produces evidence that is indispensable in identifying developments in climate change and global warming, as well as their impact. Research is also crucial in understanding the interactions of various SDGs, identifying trade-offs and mutual reinforcements and developing a balanced approach in pursuing them. Interdisciplinary is a key factor in this process.</p>

						8, 9, 12</h3>
					<p class="card-text text-justify">
						Digitalisation, automation and globalisation are changing labour markets in a rapid and radical way. The demand for highly skilled people is increasing, making re-training and up-skilling ever more important. Today in Europe, about 40% of young people have a higher education degree and this is likely to increase, as will the role of universities in providing lifelong learning. Sustainable development is only possible if we radically change the way we produce and consume. Innovative solutions must be developed in a collaborative effort.</p>
